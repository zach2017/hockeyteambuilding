I'll create an interactive hockey game for you! Let me build this with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.I've created an interactive hockey game! Here's what it includes:

**Features:**
- 🏒 Two-player local multiplayer
- ⚫ Physics-based puck with momentum and friction
- 🥅 Goals on both sides with score tracking
- 🎮 Smooth player controls
- 🎨 Ice rink design with center line and circle

**How to Play:**
- **Player 1 (Blue):** Use WASD keys to move
- **Player 2 (Red):** Use Arrow keys to move
- Push the puck into your opponent's goal to score
- Click "Start Game" to begin

The game features collision detection between players and the puck, realistic puck physics with friction, and automatic score tracking. Players bounce the puck off the walls and try to shoot it into the opponent's goal!
